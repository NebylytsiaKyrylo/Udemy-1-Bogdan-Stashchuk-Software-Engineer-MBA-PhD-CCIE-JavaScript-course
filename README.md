# Udemy-2-Bogdan-Stashchuk-Software-Engineer-MBA-PhD-CCIE-JavaScript-course

I've collected 81 assignments from my first Javascript course here.

**It is important to note** that most of the tasks were quite easy and were created to test the knowledge gained in lectures.
I marked such tasks as a **CHECK** of knowledge. Tasks that contained tasks are marked as **TASK**.
These tasks may be useful to me in the future in my work, although such tasks are no longer difficult for me.

Bogdan, a software engineer and a person with 20 years of experience in working and teaching. The knowledge gained in this course gave me a good base on javascript.

Of course, during the course I actively used additional materials from various sources. Since there is no ideal course that could cover all needs. And this course is one of the JavaScript courses I'm taking.
