I've collected 81 assignments from my first Javascript course here.

**It is important to note** that most of the tasks were quite easy and were created to test the knowledge gained in lectures.
I marked such tasks as a **CHECK** of knowledge. Tasks that contained tasks are marked as **TASK**.
These tasks may be useful to me in the future in my work, although such tasks are no longer difficult for me.
